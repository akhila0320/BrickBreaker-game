# BrickBreaker-game
Built using Java, this game combines nostalgic gameplay with modern graphics for an engaging and addictive experience.

The objective of JavaBrickBreaker is simple yet challenging: break all the bricks using a ball that bounces off a paddle at the bottom of the screen. Players control the paddle by moving it horizontally, attempting to keep the ball in play and prevent it from falling off the bottom of the screen.
